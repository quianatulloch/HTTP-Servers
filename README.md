# HTTP & Web Servers
An HTTP transaction always involves a client and a server. You're using an HTTP client right now — your web browser. HTTP was originally created to serve hypertext documents, but today is used for much more.

A server is just a program that accepts connections from other programs on the network. When you start a server program, it waits for clients to connect to it. Then when a connection comes in, the server runs a piece of code — like calling a function — to handle each incoming connection. A connection in this sense is like a phone call: it's a channel through which the client and server can talk to each other. Web clients send requests over these connections, and servers send responses back.

**404** is the HTTP status code for "Not Found".
